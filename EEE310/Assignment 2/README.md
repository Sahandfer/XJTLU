# Assignment 2

1. Write Embedded C code to Flash LED 3 in the EdSIM51 Simulator. [15]
2. Write Embedded C code to make DISP 2 (the 7 segment display 3rd from the right) count from 0 to 9 and then back to 0 (i.e. from 9 to 0) in the EdSIM51 Simulator. [35]
3. Write Embedded C code to turn on LED’s 0-3 when you press 1 on the keyboard and LED’s 4-7 when you press 2. The lights should turn off when the keyboard number is not pressed. [50]
  Submission requirements:
  i. For each problem you must submit one C program. This must have the extension C. Warning: If you submit a word or PDF file it will not be graded as I can’t compile it!
  ii. Submission will be via ICE and you will be able to submit each C code separately (i.e. 3 files can be submitted). Very Important: Do not submit compressed zip files. If you do your work will not be graded.
  iii. You should make comments in your code. The more comments you make the easier it will be for me to follow. This is important if your code doesn’t work properly. (I can give marks for non-working code with comments !)
  iv. You will be informed of the submission date on ICE.
  v. You will receive your grade and feedback within 2 weeks of the final submission date. If you wish to discuss the feedback you should contact me within 10 days of receiving your grade.
  vi. Very weak coursework (i.e. where you have < 40%) maybe re-submitted. [The mark will be limited but at least you can show you meet the learning outcome and your final grade will be improved slightly.]
