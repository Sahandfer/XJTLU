# Assignment 1
In this assignment, students are asked to improve the efficiency or security of authenticated
key exchange (AKE) protocols. Codes of AKE protocols in TLS, IEEE 802.15.6 and Bluetooth will
be given as examples; and methods to improve the efficiency and security will be introduced.
Students are going to realize lightweight AKE protocols or security-enhanced AKE protocols
using the introduced methods or their own proposed methods.
In particular, each student should
1. Realize a lightweight AKE protocol or a security-enhanced AKE protocol of his/her choice;
2. Write a short report (in MS word, single column, 11 font size, and in Calibri font style). The
report is expected to include the following parts: a) a brief description of protocol; b)
experimental platform (e.g., hardware, software); c) results, e.g., runtime, screenshots for
the experiment.
The example codes are in Python, but students can use their preferred programming language
for the tasks.
