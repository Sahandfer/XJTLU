# Lab Assignment 
## Introduction

In this Lab assignment, you will use MATLAB to develop a baseband transceiver for binary digital signals, including verification of BER performance of the optimum receiver (i.e., matched filter of shaped pulses).

## Procedure

1) Set system parametersâ€“ Including data rate, bit rate, signal (i.e., bipolar vs. unipolar binary sequence), pulse shaping (i.e., rectangular vs. root raised cosine (RRC)), number of samples per bit, pulse roll-off factor
and so on.

2) Create a binary sequence as a signal source.
3) Perform pulse shaping:
	3.1) Oversampling.
	3.2) Rectangular or RRC pulse shaping.
4) Apply channel model (AWGN).
5) Perform pulse detection (matched filtering) and down-sample the signal.
	5.1) Matched filtering.
	5.2) Downsampling.
6) Compute and plot BER vs. Eb=N0.
